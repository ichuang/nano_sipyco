# nano_sipyco

Lightweight version of m-labs' <a href="https://github.com/m-labs/sipyco">sipyco</a> which is based on standard python libraries and does not require numpy.  This works well for embedded processors and allows small computers such as the Raspberry pi to easily serve as NDSPs for <a href="https://github.com/m-labs/artiq">Artiq</a>.

Also see <a href="https://github.com/ichuang/rp2040_ndsp">rp2040_ndsp</a> for an even more simplified CircuitPython version which implements an NDSP for an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RP2040">RP2040</a> embedded processor.
